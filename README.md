# PSF-Paste_Scraping_Framework

Framework for scraping multiple "paste" sites for threat-intel teams. Data is then injested into an Elastic cluster. Will work on a Front-End once I get better coverage over more paste sites.

Currently captures
- pastebin.com (with "Pro" API Key)
- paste-bin.xyz

Future/planned scraping support includes include:
- various .onion paste applicaitons
- hatebin.com
- privatebin.info???
- paste.org.ru
- paste.ee
- pastebin.pt
- pastelink.net
- friendpaste.com
- paste.null-life.com
- hastebin.com
- dpaste.com
- cl1p.net
- Many others...

  The plan is to expand this project to capture cyber-crime forums once I get a good amount work done on the paste app scraping
